## 📅 Projects
### ✅ Day 3: Treasure Island 🏝️
A text-based adventure game where the player chooses their own path to (hopefully) find the treasure.  
This project used **conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and **input normalization** (`.strip().lower()`) to handle user choices.  

- Practiced **nested conditionals**  
- Learned to **normalize user input** with `.strip().lower()`  
- Added **ASCII art** for a more fun intro 🎨  

**Code:** [`Day03/treasure_island.py`](Day03/treasure_island.py)  
```

### ✅ Day 2: Tip Calculator 💵
Tip Calculator calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a restaurant bill, including tip.  
The program asks for the total bill, tip percentage, and number of people, then outputs the split amount.  

- Practiced **numbers and math operations**  
- Learned about **type conversion** (`int()`, `float()`)  
- Used **round()** for decimal precision  
- Introduced to **f-strings** for cleaner output  

**Code:** [`Day02/tip_calculator.py`](Day02/tip_calculator.py)  

**Sample Output:**
```
Welcome to the Tip Calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
Each person should pay: $19.90
