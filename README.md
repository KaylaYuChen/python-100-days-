## 📅 Projects

### ✅ Day 2: Tip Calculator 💵
Tip Calculator calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a restaurant bill, including tip.  
The program asks for the total bill, tip percentage, and number of people, then outputs the split amount.  

- Practiced **numbers and math operations**  
- Learned about **type conversion** (`int()`, `float()`)  
- Used **round()** for decimal precision  
- Introduced to **f-strings** for cleaner output  

**Code:** [`Day02/tip_calculator.py`](Day02/tip_calculator.py)  

**Sample Output:**
```
Welcome to the Tip Calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
Each person should pay: $19.90
```

The program asks the user for their favorite city and childhood pet, then generates a personalized band name. 
- Practiced string concatenation with `+`
- Learned about input() for collecting user input
- Added emojis for a more fun user experience 🎸🐶🌆✨  

**Code:** [Day01/band_name_generator.py](https://github.com/KaylaYuChen/python-100-days-/blob/main/Day01/band_name_generator.py)
